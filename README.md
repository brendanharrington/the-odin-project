# The Odin Project

This repository contains my solutions for the complete curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It includes work from the introductory **Foundations** course as well as all projects from both the **Full Stack JavaScript** and **Full Stack Ruby on Rails** learning paths.

The repository layout follows the structure of the curriculum:

```
the-odin-project/

  foundations/

  fullstack-javascript

  fullstack-ruby-on-rails
```

Each project is organized in its own directory and is fully self-contained, including any required documentation or dependencies.
